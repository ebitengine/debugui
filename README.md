# DebugUI for Ebitengine

DebugUI is a UI toolkit for Ebitengine applications, primarily intended for debugging purposes.

**The project is currently under development. The API is subject to frequent changes.**

![Example](./example.png)

DebugUI is based on [Microui](https://github.com/rxi/microui). The original Microui was developed by [@rxi](https://github.com/rxi/microui). The original Go port was developed by [@zeozeozeo](https://github.com/zeozeozeo) and [@Zyko0](https://github.com/Zyko0).

## Example go file
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"image"

	"github.com/ebitengine/debugui"
	"github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
)

const loopCount = 10

type Game struct {
	debugui debugui.DebugUI // Place a debugui instance on your Game
}

func (g *Game) Update() error {
	if _, err := g.debugui.Update(func(ctx *debugui.Context) error {
		ctx.Window("Debugui Window", image.Rect(0, 0, 320, 240), func(layout debugui.ContainerLayout) {
			// Place all your widgets inside a ctx.Window
			ctx.Text("Some text")

			// If you ever need to make a loop to make widgets, use ctx.Loop

			ctx.Loop(loopCount, func(index int) {
				ctx.Text(fmt.Sprintf("Index value is %d", index))
			})
		})
		return nil
	}); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}

func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
	g.debugui.Draw(screen) // Draw debugui at the end
}

func (g *Game) Layout(outsideWidth, outsideHeight int) (screenWidth, screenHeight int) {
	return outsideWidth, outsideHeight
}

func main() {
	game := &Game{}
	if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
